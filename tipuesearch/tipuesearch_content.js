Five algorithmic paths each include\na core subroutine and an easy-to-use driver.  The algorithms proceed\neither from an analytic specification of the Jacobian matrix or\ndirectly from the problem functions.  The paths include facilities for\nsystems of equations with a banded Jacobian matrix, for least squares\nproblems with a large amount of data, and for checking the consistency\nof the Jacobian matrix with the functions. This version is a modernization of the original Fortran 77 code. This is a work in progress. Modifications include:\n* Conversion from fixed ( .f ) to free-form ( .f90 ) source.\n* Modified the tests so they can be automatically run in the CI Further updates are planned...
